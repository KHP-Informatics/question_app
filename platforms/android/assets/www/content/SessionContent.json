Women tend to gain more weight than men, but the average weight gains are small: about 10 lbs.  When people gain weight, it's because they often get hungrier and eat more once they quit.  It is important for you to know, however, that the benefits of giving up cigarettes far outweigh the drawbacks of gaining a few pounds.  Dieting at the same time as quitting has been found not to work that well but you can be careful about what you eat.  Also, exercise can be good both for quitting smoking and avoiding some weight gain.  But basically, it would be important to just focus on quitting and try to eat sensibly and then if you do gain a few pounds, take the weight back off after you've successfully quit smoking. <br/><br/>There is evidence that sucking hard candies can help people to not smoke. These might be useful things to use when feeling a little hungry as well.  Mint candies are most useful because most people don't like to smoke after having some mint.<br/>",

Negative emotions (e.g., being sad or stressed)<br/>a. Exercise - it will help you unwind. Doing something healthy will make smoking seem a bit weird. Why would you smoke after doing something good for your body? <br/>b. Socialize - call a friend, go out, chat online, try to meet someone new without cigarettes <br/>c. Do something pleasant - cuddle with your cat, read a book, draw a picture or make something, cook your favorite meal  , watch a funny video online, listen to music <br/>d. Do something kind for someone else - use some of your ideas that you've listed in this app, write something nice on social media for a friend, go to http://freerice.com, a website that donates food for playing vocab games<br/>e. Do something distracting - play games on your phone, do a crossword puzzle or soduku, try some trivia on sporcle.com <br/>f. Remember self-care - you'll be less likely to give in to negative emotions if you have plenty of rest, are eating well, taking time for yourself, and getting plenty of fluids <br/>2. Positive emotions (e.g., to celebrate, enjoy)<br/>a. Treat yourself to a non-lethal replacement treat - a cup of tea, a hot chocolate, an ice-cream, some nachos<br/>b. Savor the joyful moment on its own merit - you don't need a cigarette to rejoice that it's the weekend, for example<br/>c. Share your happiness with others - call, email, text, chat online, and/or meet your family and friends and share the moment<br/>d. Think of how much longer you'll be able to enjoy these things by not smoking - you'll have a longer, healthier life! <br/>3. Social situations<br/>a. When offered a cigarette, say \"no thanks, I no longer smoke\"<br/>b. Before being offered a cigarette, ask your friend(s) to say \"no\" for you<br/>c. Be elsewhere - simply avoid the situation <br/>d. When feeling awkward without a cigarette, keep your hands busy - drink a glass of water, chew on a snack, play with your smartphone (you can even show off this app!)<br/>e. Stay inside when others go outside to smoke - ask a friend to stay inside with you for the night <br/>f. Remember that you are helping others by not smoking - you're serving as an example to smokers of how to quit, you're not harming others with second-hand smoke, you're not making others smell cigarettes <br/>g. Ask to go out where you can't smoke - the movies, library, restaurant or coffee shop, bowling alley, zoo <br/>4. Drinking alcohol<br/>a. Avoid drinking occasions - your cravings will be less strong if you are simply not in this situation<br/>b. Make sure you have no cigarettes or lighters on you<br/>c. Ask your friends ahead of time not to give any cigarettes to you, even if you ask<br/>d. Stay inside when others go outside to smoke - ask a friend to stay inside with you for the night <br/>e. If you are going out, try somewhere that has activities (darts, pool, video games, dancing), so you won't feel awkward or bored staying inside <br/>5. Habitual smoking (e.g., when driving/walking, while taking a break, after a meal)<br/>a. Change the routine in question - take a different route to work, go for a walk as your break, drink a juice instead of a coffee or change your coffee flavor/shop, etc.<br/>b. Change what you do right afterwards - for example, after a meal, get up from the table immediately and do a different activity for five minutes before cleaning up, sit in a different room, call a friend<br/>c. Use mints - they'll make you not want to smoke<br/>d. Chew on something - carrots are wonderful<br/>6. Places that are triggers (e.g., porch, bedroom, friend's house) <br/>a. Throw away the ashtray, any containers you put cigarettes in, empty cartons, put lighters out of reach <br/>b. Change things up - move around the furniture a bit, get a new decoration, anything to make the space feel different <br/>c. If you smoke inside, try to spray the area with an air freshener, wash clothing items and blankets. Getting rid of the smell  of smoke will help avoid cravings and will be more pleasant! <br/>d. Come prepared - have some hard candy, remind your friends that you are now a non-smoker, know you can always leave if the cravings get too strong <br/>7. Wanting something to do with your hands (e.g., during social situations, on the phone, watching tv, walking)<br/>a. Have a stress ball, worry stone with an inspirational word on it, silly putty, play dough  to keep your hands occupied <br/>b. Make coffee or tea - the motions of making yourself a nice drink can be soothing <br/>c. Use hand lotion <br/>d. Draw, cook, play cards or start a new hobby <br/>7. any type of situation<br/>a. Delay lighting up that cigarette - before you know it, you will have moved right past the urge to smoke.<br/>b. Breathe deeply - and savor breathing in fresh, clean air as you breathe in rather than cancer-causing chemicals <br/>c. Remind yourself of YOUR reasons for quitting - we'll send you a reminder, too<br/>d. Distract yourself - play a game on your smartphone, check your email, text a friend, take a picture with your smartphone  <br/>",

It's the first two weeks that are the hardest, so if they can make this time easier for you, it'll pay off.  Simply text or call a friend, let others know you are quitting, set up a time to get dinner with a friend next week to celebrate one week of being quit.  Sharing this experience with others will make your quit attempt even more special - and successful.<br/><br/>If you are worried about it being uncomfortable or even a little embarrassing to ask for help, keep this in mind: your family and friends care about you and want to see you live a healthy life.  And you would help them if they asked you, right?",
